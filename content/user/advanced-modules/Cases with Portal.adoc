= Advanced Open Cases with Portal

== Introduction

Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) is an enhancement to the case management
module in SuiteCRM. There is also a Joomla component. AOP extends the
core cases functionality and enhances mechanisms for contacts to update
cases.

This module allows contacts held within SuiteCRM to:

* *Retrieve emails regarding updates to your Cases*
* *Create Cases by emailing a defined support address*
* *Update Cases by replying to Case emails*

This module is, regretfully, currently unable, without your own custom coding using logic hooks to:

* *Automate much of the functionality (except for creating a case from an Email - the portal changes the way that you interact with end-users who create cases but it cannot, for example:

* *Pull through the first name or a surname or the subject from an Email sent in to a group inbox, configured to generate an automatic reply using a new case template in a case being automatically set up. Currently this means that the end user will receive an Email containing a variable name as opposed to the variable contents.  

* *Create a contact from a case automatically (even with Workflow options, the end user details are not pulled through to the case in the first place. 

* *Automatically send a portal login to the user. 

* *Send Emails to third parties where the Administrator wishes to involve a third party outside of your organisation or project. 

* *The module does not have any scheduling functionality built in - for example, for chase Emails to be sent. 

* *The module does not have any styling options to fit in with your Joomla website design, out of the box. 

**The module is only available for Joomla websites but you are free to adapt the code to suit your own needs for alternative Content Mangement Systems that are otherwise not supported. 

It is therefore vitally important to understand from the outset what the module is and what it isn't before you continue. We hope to further develop the portal at a later date but we can't say when due to the limited resources and significant backlog of and within the developent team. We are however looking for volunteers to help with this project to develop the code but you may alternatively wish to consider the paid third-party portal options available in the store if you are unable to develop the portal module to suit your own needs. 

The module allows SuiteCRM users to: Add updates to Cases View a
threaded log of all updates Retrieve email notifications when a contact
adds an update to a Case Create Joomla users from a Contact The AOP
Joomla component connects a Joomla site to the SuiteCRM instance. This
allows SuiteCRM Contacts to: View a list of your Cases online Create new
Cases online Reply to existing cases View your case details including a
threaded log of all updates

Emails Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) uses the standard SuiteCRM
functionality to send emails and create cases from inbound emails.
Details on how to configure your outgoing email settings can be found
link:../../../admin/administration-panel/email/#_outgoing_mail_configuration[here].
Details on how to set up a group email account which will
automatically generate cases can be found link:../../../admin/administration-panel/email/#_group_email_account[here].

== Downloading

The plug-in can be downloaded for free from the SuiteCRM site at 
the https://suitecrm.com/resources/suitecrm-joomla-portal-plug-in/[Joomla Portal Plug-in page^].

== Installation & Configuration

System Administrator users can configure the settings by accessing the
AOP settings through the admin panel.

Here you can enable or disable the AOP functionality, configure the
Joomla URL, set the case distribution method, “email from” details and
the different email templates.

To install the Joomla AOP component, use the "Extension Manager" inside Joomla.
Once installed you must configure the SuiteCRM URL and a valid SuiteCRM
username and password. This can be done by navigating to Components →
advancedopen-portal.

Once you have configured the Joomla component you can add two new Main
Menu items to your Joomla portal. These are:

* *List Cases* - This shows a list of all Cases that the Contact has
logged. This page also provides a search mechanism to filter cases.
* *New Case* – This page will allow Contacts to create Cases in SuiteCRM
from the Joomla portal.

== Using Advanced OpenPortal

[discrete]
==== Creating a Portal User

To create a Portal User a SuiteCRM User must first create a Contact for
the Portal User using the standard SuiteCRM functionality. Once created
you must click btn:[Create Portal User]. This can be found at the
top left hand side of the Contact record Detail View.

{{% notice note %}}
If you have action menus enabled the button will be within the
action menu.
{{% /notice %}}

Once clicked, a new user will be created in Joomla and the Contact will
be sent your portal credentials via email.

==== Creating a Case via the Portal

Portal Users can create a new Case by going to the New Case page on the
portal website.

From here Portal Users can enter the details of your issue and attach
any supporting documents. The dropdown values are dynamically pulled
from the SuiteCRM instance and thus can be edited using the drop down
editor tool within SuiteCRM.

{{% notice note %}}
This feature does use the Joomla cache so please clear cache
after an update has been made. When the case is ready to be logged,
click the button. This will create the Case within SuiteCRM.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Viewing Cases via the Portal

Portal Users can view a list of all your Cases using the List Cases
page. This will also allow you to filter your search by State (All, Open
or Closed) or by keyword. When searching by keyword it will search the
'Number', 'Subject', 'Status', 'Created' and 'Last Update' fields to
find your result.

To view more information on the case and to add updates then Portal
Users can click the *'Subject'* of case.

From the case view Portal Users can view all the external updates added
to the case from both Joomla and SuiteCRM. This is displayed in a
threaded format showing who updated the case Any attached files to
updates will also be accessible from this view. When a Portal User
updates a case the assigned SuiteCRM user of the case will be notified
by email.

==== Creating and Updating Cases from SuiteCRM

You can create and update Cases from SuiteCRM. To add an update to an
existing record Users will add text to the 'Update' field within the
case Detail View and click 'Save'. This will publish the update to the
portal and send an email to any Contacts related to the Case.

image:image152.png[title="Creating and Updating Cases"]

If Users check the 'Internal Update' field then the update will appear
in SuiteCRM only. It will not appear in Joomla and the Contact will not
be emailed.

image:image153.png[title="Creating and Updating Cases"]

The Case Detail View will show the full threaded update log.

Additional Contacts can be added to the Case using the Contacts sub
panel. All emails exchanged between the system, the contact and you will
be attached to the History sub-panel. Any documents attached to the case
using the Portal are held as Notes within this sub-panel.

==== Status Drop Down

Within Cases, you can specify both a State and a Status value. The State
determines if the Case is Open or Closed. Depending on the State you
will be offered different statuses. You can amend these statuses using
the Dropdown Editor Tool within the Admin Developer Tools. When adding a
new Status you must define the Item Name as “`<parent dropdown item
name>_ItemName`” For example “`Open_New`” or “`Closed_Rejected`”. All values
with an Item Name prefixed with “`Open_`” will show when the state is
Open, similarly all with the prefix “`Closed_`” will show when the state
is closed.
